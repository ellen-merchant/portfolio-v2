The API communicates with multiple databases including our core PostreSQL database and third-party APIs and services. This involves working alongside the product manager, front end developers and QA engineers to produce tested, production code and working to tight deadlines. I have been developing and maintaining the backend since I started at the company and in 2020 became wholly responsible for all our PHP/Laravel projects, innovating the way the application is tested using tools like PHPUnit and continuous integration (CI)."

After providing foundations for other developers to learn and contribute to, I continued to implement larger features including using OIDC to connect to multiple identity providers, producing internal libraries for shared code and access controls."
