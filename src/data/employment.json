More recently I have developed a public web portal for our customers where they configure and monitor the different products and services they have with the company. Although the company was fully established when I joined, my team was treated as a start up, therefore, I have been able to influence high level decisions such as programming techniques and tools and vastly expanding the company data centre infrastructure, showing I am motivated and proactive."
