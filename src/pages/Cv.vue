      <h3>Personal Statement</h3>
      In 2010 I finished my degree in Computing gaining a 2:1 with Honours.
      Since I graduated I have been working for a Telecommunications company as
      part of the Development team. I was first brought on-board as a Developer
      to utilise my skills in languages such as PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS and
      JavaScript. However, I was keen to expand my abilities to other areas
      which included learning new skills in the DevOps role. I feel I am a big
      part of making the team successful, this includes implementing the Laravel
      framework, which has vastly improved productivity. I recently got promoted
      to Software Team Lead, where I manage, mentor and train a small team of
      Software Developers to ensure software is produced at a high quality using
      best practices.
